    {\begin{itemize}
      \item Collaborated in classifying the radio galaxies according to
        the morphologies using a deep Convolutional Neutral Network (CNN).
      \item Developed the
        \link{https://github.com/liweitianux/fg21sim}{\texttt{FG21sim}}
        software to simulate low-frequency radio sky images.
      \item Used algorithms such as wavelet to denoise and enhance X-ray
        astronomical images.
      \item Extracted both the spatial and spectral information of X-ray
        images, and used the Support Vector Machine (SVM) to identify the
        potential point sources.
      \item Significantly improved the modeling of radio halos,
        and integrated the instrumental effects of radio interferometers
        into the simulation pipeline.
      \item Quantitatively evaluated the impacts of radio halos on the
        detection of reionization signals, and finished the journal paper.

        \textit{Chandra} X-ray Observatory, and analyzed the images and
        spectra.
      \item Built a sample of galaxy clusters, collected optical data from
        SDSS, and investigated the correlation between the central emission
        excess and the central dominating galaxy.
      \item Developed and maintained a suite of data analysis utilities:
