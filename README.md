My Resumes and LaTeX Template
=============================

**Weitian LI** `<wt@liwt.net>`

Introduction
------------
This repository holds my resumes ([Chinese](resume-zh.pdf) and
[English](resume-en.pdf) versions),
the [resume LaTeX template](resume.cls),
and the [Font Awesome 5 LaTeX style](fontawesome5/fontawesome5.sty).

This template is based on the
[YACC: Another Awesome CV](https://github.com/darwiin/yaac-another-awesome-cv)
by Christophe Roger, which is further based on the
[Plasmati Graduate CV](https://www.latextemplates.com/template/plasmati-graduate-cv)
by Alessandro Plasmati.

Font Awesome 5
--------------
I wrote a simple tool [`make-fontawesome5.py`](fontawesome5/make-fontawesome5.py)
to generate the LaTeX style file for using the latest **Font Awesome 5**
(the *free* edition) in LaTeX.
A pre-generated style file [`fontawesome5.sty`](fontawesome5/fontawesome5.sty)
(matches Font Awesome **v5.2.0**) is also provided.

The Font Awesome fonts are designed by the
[Font Awesome project](https://fontawesome.com/)
and can be obtained from [here](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-desktop).
**NOTE**: All the following 3 fonts should be installed into the system:
* Font Awesome 5 Free
  (generic icons in regular style, much less than the solid style)
* Font Awesome 5 Free Solid
  (generic icons in solid style)
* Font Awesome 5 Free Brands
  (various brand icons)

The following opensource fonts are used in the template:
