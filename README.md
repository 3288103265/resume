Introduction
------------
This repository holds my resume (both Chinese and English version),
and the LaTeX template, which I hope can help others with their resumes.

This template is based on the
[YACC: Another Awesome CV](https://github.com/darwiin/yaac-another-awesome-cv)
by Christophe Roger, which is further based on the
[Plasmati Graduate CV](https://www.latextemplates.com/template/plasmati-graduate-cv)
by Alessandro Plasmati.
